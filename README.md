Stock C++ code for the Language Library Design of C++ with Bjarne Stroustrup.

Sorting program:
- Program generates N random integers and inserts them into a sequence so that each is inserted in its proper position in the numerical order.

- We then remove elements one at a time by picking a random position in the sequence and remove the element there.

- The sequence grows incrementally.
